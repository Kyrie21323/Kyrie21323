# 👋 Hi! I'm Kyrie Park  

🎓 CS & Interactive Media double major @ NYU Abu Dhabi  
💡 Exploring the intersection of **data, vision, and interaction** through robust software engineering.  

I build **scalable systems, computer vision pipelines, and data-driven tools** that push beyond “working code” toward **performance, reliability, and insight**. My projects often start from creative ideas, but they’re grounded in **algorithms, optimization, and experimentation** — whether that’s aligning 10,000 images with FFT-based ROI matching, simulating motion for ergonomic analysis, or designing game systems with ethical AI trade-offs.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Exploring  
📷 **Computer Vision** — feature detection, ROI alignment, image similarity (ORB, FFT, phase correlation)  
🤖 **Machine Learning** — applying PCA, t-SNE, and clustering to analyze patterns in image and behavioral data  
🧱 **Backend Architecture** — scalable FastAPI/Django services with optimized relational + in-memory databases  
🔄 **ETL & Data Pipelines** — preprocessing, anomaly detection, and large-scale data cleaning workflows
