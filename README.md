# 👋 Hi! I'm Kyrie Park

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and Interactive Media double major at NYU Abu Dhabi.  
🔍 I build creative tools, games, and systems that explore the intersections of **technology, emotion, and storytelling**.

Whether it’s analyzing how influencers are perceived online, detecting inefficient cursor behavior, or crafting ethical strategy games set inside the human body, I enjoy designing systems that reflect how we think, feel, and interact.
