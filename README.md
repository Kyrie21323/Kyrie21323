# 👋 Hi! I'm Kyrie Park  

🎓 CS & Interactive Media double major @ NYU Abu Dhabi  
💡 Exploring the intersection of **data, vision, and interaction** through robust software engineering.  

I build **scalable systems, computer vision pipelines, and data-driven tools** that push beyond “working code” toward **performance, reliability, and insight**. My projects often start from creative ideas, but they’re grounded in **algorithms, optimization, and experimentation** — whether that’s aligning 10,000 images with FFT-based ROI matching, simulating motion for ergonomic analysis, or designing game systems with ethical AI trade-offs.

## 🔧 Featured Projects  
📱 [**NFC Networking Platform**](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Capstone.git) (WIP)  
An event networking platform based on Flask, integrating NFC and NLP matching to bridge digital and physical interactions through smart event management and secure attendee connections.

🖱️ [**SenseFit**](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sense_Fit.git)  
A desktop tool that tracks and analyzes cursor movement to suggest ergonomic adjustments and prevent wrist strain for long-term computer users.

🎭 [**vibeCHECK**](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/VibeCheck-Backend)  
A sentiment-based social voting web app that lets users rate influencers based on behavior across multiple platforms (e.g., TMZ, YouTube).

🖥️ [**MicroShell-OS**](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/MicroShell-OS.git)  
A custom Unix-style shell and networked job scheduler built in C, demonstrating OS-level process control, socket programming, and multi-threaded job management.

📊 [**CharityBuzz**](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/CharityBuzz)  
A data-driven analysis tool that explores how media coverage correlates with charity campaign success using web scraping, fuzzy matching, and Pandas-based preprocessing.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Exploring  
📷 **Computer Vision** — feature detection, ROI alignment, image similarity (ORB, FFT, phase correlation)  
🤖 **Machine Learning** — applying PCA, t-SNE, and clustering to analyze patterns in image and behavioral data  
🧱 **Backend Architecture** — scalable FastAPI/Django services with optimized relational + in-memory databases  
🔄 **ETL & Data Pipelines** — preprocessing, anomaly detection, and large-scale data cleaning workflows  
🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — sentence embedding, keyword extraction, and transformer-based semantic similarity for intelligent user matching and text-driven insights
